Make sure you have installed PsychoPy on your own computer from this link before attempting the challenges: PsychoPy download Download a copy of the PsychoPy experiment at this link LexDecTaskCopy.zip Extract the files from that zip folder (right click -&gt; extract all on Windows) Double click on LexDecTaskCopy.psyexp Complete the challenges, which are: Change the screen colour to white, and the text colour to black, throughout the experiment Increase the stimulus duration from 3 to 5 seconds Turn off feedback in the experimental (but not the practice) block. "],["colours.html", "Chapter 2 Colours 2.1 Change the screen colour to white 2.2 Change the text colour to black 2.3 Save the experiment 2.4 Run the experiment", " Chapter 2 Colours Change the screen colour to white, and the text colour to black, throughout the experiment. There are two things you need to do to accomplish this. 2.1 Change the screen colour to white By default, PsychoPy uses a grey background. In the Lexical Decision Task we used a black background. You can access the screen colour property from the cog wheel symbol: then the Screen tabs Color property: Now that you have chosen white as the background, you need to save the experiment using the conventional save button: 2.2 Change the text colour to black By default, Psychopy uses white text against a grey background. Now that you have changed the screen colour to white, all the text that is white in colour will be invisible. So you need to change the text colour to black. There isnt an experiment-wide place to change the colour of text: text colour is a property of each individual text component. A text component looks like a red T: You need to go through each of the routines to find where the text boxes are: here we click on the intro routine in the Flow pane at the bottom of the interface, and its text box: The Appearancetab is where you can specify properties of this particular text box; and one of those properties is itsForeground Color You need to go through all the routines looking for text boxes that currently display white text, and change them to display black text. 2.3 Save the experiment Save the experiment. 2.4 Run the experiment Run the experiment to see whether your changes worked. You can press escape after a few trials if you dont need to run the whole experiment. "],["stimulus-duration.html", "Chapter 3 Stimulus duration 3.1 Change the stimulus duration 3.2 Save the experiment 3.3 Run the experiment", " Chapter 3 Stimulus duration Increase the stimulus duration from 3 to 5 seconds. 3.1 Change the stimulus duration The routine that contains the stimulus is trial. Click on trial. See the TextBox called word. Click on word to bring up its properties. See that duration is set to 3.0 seconds. To change the duration to 5 seconds, replace 3.0 with 5.0 3.2 Save the experiment Save the experiment. 3.3 Run the experiment Run the experiment to see whether your changes worked. You can press escape after a few trials if you dont need to run the whole experiment. "],["feedback.html", "Chapter 4 Feedback 4.1 Turn off feedback 4.2 Save the experiment 4.3 Run the experiment", " Chapter 4 Feedback Turn off feedback in the experimental (but not the practice) block. 4.1 Turn off feedback The routine that contains the feedback is trial_feedback. Click on trial_feedback. See the code component. Click on the code component.. Put your cursor in the first line of the left hand side. Type: if phase == &quot;experimental&quot;: continueRoutine = False So that the code component looks like this: 4.2 Save the experiment Save the experiment. 4.3 Run the experiment Run the experiment to see whether your changes worked. You can press escape after a few trials if you dont need to run the whole experiment.
