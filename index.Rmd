# About

This site explains the student challenges for the lexical decision task

1. Download a copy of the PsychoPy experiment called [LexDecTaskCopy.psyexp](./LexDecTaskCopy.psyexp)

1. Change the screen colour to white, and the text colour to black, throughout the experiment
2. Increase the stimulus duration from 3 to 5 seconds
3. Turn off feedback in the experimental (but not the practice) block.
3. At the end, instead of having the participant press a key to end the experiment, make the experiment finish automatically after 2 seconds
