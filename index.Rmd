  * [**LexDecTaskCopy.zip**](./LexDecTaskCopy.zip)

* Then, complete the challenges, which are:
  1. Change the screen colour to white, and the text colour to black, throughout the experiment
  2. Increase the stimulus duration from 3 to 5 seconds
  3. Turn off feedback in the experimental (but not the practice) block.
  4. At the end, instead of having the participant press a key to end the experiment, make the experiment finish automatically after 2 seconds
